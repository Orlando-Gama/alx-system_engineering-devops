Issue Summary
Duration: January 14, 2024, 7:00 PM - January 21, 2024, 7:00 PM (UTC)

Impact:

Service Affected: API endpoints for advanced features.
User Experience: Users encountered frequent timeouts and 500 errors, affecting 15% of the API requests.
Root Cause: Database connection pool exhaustion due to a surge in API requests.
Timeline
January 14, 2024, 7:00 PM: API Turbulence

Users reported frequent timeouts while accessing advanced API features.
7:15 PM: Initial Checks

Ensured server health and validated the status of essential services.
7:30 PM: Performance Analysis

Observed degraded performance in API responses and identified a surge in request volume.
8:00 PM: Connection Pool Red Alert

Detected database connection pool reaching critical levels.
8:15 PM: Emergency Scaling

Initiated dynamic scaling to accommodate the increased API request load.
January 15, 2024, 6:00 AM: Service Stability

The dynamic scaling stabilized the service, but intermittent 500 errors persisted.
January 21, 2024, 8:00 AM: Deep Dive into Logs

Investigated logs to identify the root cause of lingering 500 errors.
8:30 AM: Database Conundrum

Root Cause and Resolution
Root Cause:
The surge in advanced API requests overwhelmed the database connection pool, leading to timeouts and 500 errors.

Resolution:

Immediate Fix: Initiated dynamic scaling to alleviate the immediate load.
Long-Term Solution:
Optimized database queries to reduce connection pool stress.
Implemented additional caching mechanisms to handle API request peaks.
Corrective and Preventive Measures
Advanced API Monitoring:

Enhance monitoring for advanced API endpoints to proactively detect unusual traffic patterns.
Load Testing Extravaganza:

Conduct thorough load testing on advanced API features to anticipate and prepare for peak usage.
Caching Strategy Enhancement:

Implement advanced caching mechanisms to reduce the load on the database during traffic spikes.
Database Scaling Protocol:

Establish protocols for automated database scaling based on real-time usage metrics.
Lessons Learned
This incident emphasized the critical importance of anticipating and managing spikes in advanced API usage. By implementing a combination of immediate fixes and long-term optimizations, we aim to fortify our system against similar challenges in the future.
